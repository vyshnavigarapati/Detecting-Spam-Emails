# Detecting-Spam-Emails
> A machine learning project for classifying emails as spam or non-spam using natural language processing techniques.
This project, Detecting Spam Emails, focuses on building an intelligent email classification system that automatically distinguishes between spam and legitimate (ham) emails. The primary objective is to enhance email security and user experience by filtering out unwanted messages using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled email messages categorized as spam or non-spam. The data undergoes several preprocessing steps, including text cleaning, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF and Bag of Words. After preprocessing, various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest are trained and evaluated to determine the best-performing model.

The project also includes model performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with a confusion matrix for visualization. It demonstrates how NLP can be integrated with ML algorithms to handle real-world problems related to spam detection and text classification.

Technologies and Tools Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
NLTK for text preprocessing
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
Google Colab for implementation
This project serves as a practical example of applying machine learning and NLP in cybersecurity-related domains and can be extended further using deep learning techniques such as LSTM or BERT for enhanced accuracy.
